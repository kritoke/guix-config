apply-globalconfig.sh - applies the standard global configuration apply command
apply-homeconfig.sh - applies the guix home reconfigure command (useful when you make adjustments to it)
duplicate-configs.sh - for now a simple way to make easy copies of other config files for guix to backup to git until a more elegant solution is found.
update-system.sh - applys the pull and then upgrade command to update the packages.
